# PullToRefresh-JQM

Warning!!! Immature code here!

I created this Pull to Refresh library for JQuery mobile as a base. It works, but it is still buggy. Feel free to hack away.

Just clone the REPO, and double click the pullToRefresh.html file. It will open in your default browser. You will need to enable the touch simulator for your browser.
